Yes, you can definitely add a node from another node pack to the list of LoRA nodes. To do this, you would modify the addSetting call for "Lora" in the modelInfo.js file. Here's how you can do it:
1. Identify the name of the node you want to add. Let's say it's called "CustomLoraLoader" from another node pack.
2. Determine if you want to target a specific widget within that node (like "lora_name") or if you want to apply it to the whole node.
Add the node to the list in the addSetting call. Here's an example of how you might do this:
If you want to apply it to the whole node without specifying a widget, you can just add the node name:
After making this change, save the file and restart ComfyUI. The "View Info..." option should now be available for your custom LoRA node as well.
Remember that the node name you add here should match exactly how it's defined in the other node pack. If you're unsure about the exact name, you might need to check the source code of that node pack or consult its documentation.
